# simple-ssrf-app
Simple Python Flask app I made a while ago to use during various CTF setups. Figured out that someone might as well need it. Just start it & enjoy!

## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/adeadfed/simple-ssrf-app/
cd simple-ssrf-app
pyhon3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```
